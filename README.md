This GitHub repository contains a Python script (`customer_segmentation_project_sql.py`) and a Jupyter Notebook (`Customer_Segmentation_Project_SQL.ipynb`) that perform data analysis on a hotel reservation dataset using SQL queries. The project aims to gain insights into customer behavior, booking patterns, and revenue-related factors for the hotel industry.

##The analysis starts by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation and sqlite3 for creating and interacting with a SQLite database. The hotel reservation dataset (`Hotel Reservation Dataset.csv`) is then uploaded and read into a pandas DataFrame.

##Next, a SQLite database (`hotel_reservations.db`) is created, and the DataFrame is written to a table named `reservations` within the database.

##The analysis then proceeds to answer a series of questions by executing SQL queries on the database. Here's a breakdown of each query and its significance:

1. **Total Number of Reservations**
   - Query: `SELECT SUM(no_of_adults) AS total_adults, SUM(no_of_children) AS total_children FROM hotel_reservations;`
   - Significance: This query calculates the total number of adults and children across all reservations, revealing that there are 1,316 adults and 69 children in the dataset, totaling 1,385 hotel reservations.

2. **Confirmed and Canceled Reservations**
   - Query: `SELECT booking_status, SUM(no_of_adults) AS total_adults, SUM(no_of_children) AS total_children FROM hotel_reservations GROUP BY booking_status;`
   - Significance: This query groups the reservations by their booking status (canceled or confirmed) and calculates the total adults and children for each group. The results show that there are 433 canceled reservations (402 adults and 31 children) and 952 confirmed reservations (914 adults and 38 children).

3. **Most Popular Meal Plan**
   - Query: `SELECT type_of_meal_plan, COUNT(Booking_ID) AS reservation_count FROM hotel_reservations GROUP BY type_of_meal_plan ORDER BY reservation_count DESC LIMIT 1;`
   - Significance: This query groups the reservations by the type of meal plan and counts the number of reservations for each plan. The result shows that "Meal Plan 1" is the most popular, with 527 reservations.

4. **Average Price per Room for Reservations Involving Children**
   - Query: `SELECT round(AVG(avg_price_per_room)) AS avg_price FROM hotel_reservations WHERE no_of_children > 0;`
   - Significance: This query calculates the average price per room for reservations involving children, which is found to be $145.

5. **Reservations Made in 2018**
   - Query: `SELECT COUNT(Booking_ID) AS Total_Reservation_2018 FROM hotel_reservations WHERE arrival_date like '%2018%';`
   - Significance: This query counts the number of reservations made for the year 2018, which is 577.

6. **Most Commonly Booked Room Type**
   - Query: `SELECT room_type_reserved, COUNT(Booking_ID) AS reservation_count FROM hotel_reservations GROUP BY room_type_reserved ORDER BY reservation_count DESC LIMIT 1;`
   - Significance: This query groups the reservations by the room type and counts the number of reservations for each type. The result shows that "Room_Type 1" is the most commonly booked room type, with 534 reservations.

7. **Reservations Falling on Weekends**
   - Query: `SELECT COUNT(no_of_weekend_nights) AS weekend_reservations FROM hotel_reservations WHERE no_of_weekend_nights > 0;`
   - Significance: This query counts the number of reservations that include at least one weekend night, which is 383.

8. **Highest and Lowest Lead Time for Reservations**
   - Query: `SELECT MAX(lead_time) AS max_lead_time, MIN(lead_time) AS min_lead_time FROM hotel_reservations;`
   - Significance: This query finds the maximum and minimum lead times (the number of days between the booking and the arrival date) for all reservations. The results show that the highest lead time is 443 days, and the lowest is 0 days.

9. **Most Common Market Segment Type**
   - Query: `SELECT market_segment_type, COUNT(Booking_ID) AS reservation_count FROM hotel_reservations GROUP BY market_segment_type ORDER BY reservation_count DESC LIMIT 1;`
   - Significance: This query groups the reservations by the market segment type and counts the number of reservations for each type. The result shows that the "Online" market segment is the most common, with 518 reservations.

10. **Confirmed Reservations**
    - Query: `SELECT COUNT(Booking_ID) AS confirmed_reservations FROM hotel_reservations WHERE booking_status = 'Not_Canceled';`
    - Significance: This query counts the number of confirmed reservations (not canceled), which is 493.

11. **Total Adults and Children**
    - Query: `SELECT SUM(no_of_adults) AS total_adults, SUM(no_of_children) AS total_children FROM hotel_reservations;`
    - Significance: This query calculates the total number of adults and children across all reservations, which is 1,316 adults and 69 children.

12. **Average Weekend Nights for Reservations Involving Children**
    - Query: `SELECT AVG(no_of_weekend_nights) AS avg_weekend_nights FROM hotel_reservations WHERE no_of_children > 0;`
    - Significance: This query calculates the average number of weekend nights for reservations involving children, which is 1 night.

13. **Reservations per Month**
    - Query: `SELECT arrival_date as month,COUNT(Booking_ID) as reservation_per_month FROM hotel_reservations group by arrival_date`
    - Significance: This query groups the reservations by the arrival date (month) and counts the number of reservations for each month. The results provide insights into the hotel's seasonal demand patterns.

14. **Average Total Nights per Room Type**
    - Query: `SELECT room_type_reserved, round(AVG(no_of_weekend_nights + no_of_week_nights)) AS avg_total_nights FROM hotel_reservations GROUP BY room_type_reserved;`
    - Significance: This query calculates the average total nights (both weekend and weekday) spent by guests for each room type. The results can help identify popular room types and plan resource allocation accordingly.

15. **Most Common Room Type for Reservations Involving Children and its Average Price**
    - Query: `WITH child_reservations AS (SELECT room_type_reserved, avg_price_per_room FROM hotel_reservations WHERE no_of_children > 0) SELECT room_type_reserved, round(AVG(avg_price_per_room)) AS avg_price FROM child_reservations GROUP BY room_type_reserved ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;`
    - Significance: This query first filters the reservations involving children, then groups them by room type and calculates the average price for each room type. The result shows that "Room_Type 1" is the most common room type for reservations involving children, with an average price of $123.

16. **Market Segment Type with the Highest Average Price per Room**
    - Query: `SELECT market_segment_type, round(AVG(avg_price_per_room)) AS avg_price FROM hotel_reservations GROUP BY market_segment_type ORDER BY avg_price DESC LIMIT 1;`
    - Significance: This query groups the reservations by the market segment type and calculates the average price per room for each segment. The result shows that the "Online" market segment generates the highest average price per room, which is $112.
